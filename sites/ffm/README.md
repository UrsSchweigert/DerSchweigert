# Arithmo Slayer system documentation

This document describes the system as it exists in the repository today so future work can start from the code's current truth rather than the original build prompt.

## What Arithmo Slayer is

Arithmo Slayer is a browser math game shipped as:

- a static frontend under `sites/ffm/static/`
- a Flask JSON API under `sites/ffm/app/`
- an AWS deployment made of CloudFront + S3 for static assets and API Gateway + Lambda for `/api/*`

The production host is `https://ffm.derschweigert.de`.

## Important current behavior

### Frontend/gameplay

- The game is a single static page with a canvas plus DOM overlays for auth, difficulty selection, level clear, game over, and input.
- `main.js` owns almost all runtime state in one module-level `state` object plus a few side arrays (`fiends`, `spawnQueue`, `requeuedFiends`, `answerTimes`, `activeLightningBolts`).
- The current curriculum is **60 levels**, not 40. The tests enforce four 15-level blocks.
- Each level currently uses `waveSize: 30`, but the current loop behaves more like "30 enemies per level" than a multi-wave system:
  - `waveNumber` exists in state but is not driving any real multi-wave progression.
  - `triggerWaveClear()` immediately transitions to level clear after all queued/requeued fiends are defeated.
- Only **one fiend is allowed on screen at a time** right now because `spawnNextFiend()` returns early if any fiend is still present.
- Requeue-on-wrong-answer is implemented:
  - wrong answer or timeout hurts the hero
  - the correct equation is revealed for 2 seconds
  - the fiend retreats and is appended to `requeuedFiends`
- Input mode is data-driven per level:
  - `multiple-choice` uses the four DOM buttons
  - `free-text` uses the text input and Strike button
- Score is computed client-side from base points + speed bonus + combo bonus, with an elite multiplier for rare elite fiends.
- On game over the frontend posts only the **overall high score** to `/api/high-score`.
- The per-level `/api/score` endpoint exists in the backend, but the current frontend does not call it.

### Auth/profile/leaderboard

- `api.js` stores the access token only in memory.
- Registration returns an access token, but only login/refresh set the refresh cookie.
- Refresh/logout depend on the `refresh_token` cookie and same-origin requests with credentials.
- Leaderboard grouping is by `first_grade_year`, not by level.
- The splash screen can prompt logged-in users without a `first_grade_year` to complete their profile so they appear in year buckets.

### Backend/data model

- Persistence is **DynamoDB only** in the live code path.
- `sites/ffm/app/models.py` uses two tables:
  - `ffm-users`
  - `ffm-scores`
- The tables use compound keys `pk` + `sk`.
- `ffm-users` stores:
  - `USER#<username>` / `PROFILE`
  - `EMAIL#<email>` / `REF`
- `ffm-scores` stores:
  - `USER#<username>` / `LEVEL#<level>#<difficulty>`
  - `USER#<username>` / `HIGHSCORE`
- Leaderboards are produced by scanning `HIGHSCORE` items, sorting in application code, and then grouping by `first_grade_year`.

## Deployment shape

The dedicated FFM stack now exists under `infra/terraform/sites/ffm/`.

- Static site: shared `static_site` Terraform module
- API: shared `api_backend` Terraform module
- Lambda function name: `ffm-api`
- DynamoDB tables:
  - `ffm-users`
  - `ffm-scores`
  - `ffm-ratelimits` (flask-limiter's `dynamodb://` storage backend; see `app/ratelimit_storage.py`)
- JWT signing key: Secrets Manager secret `ffm/jwt-secret-key`, passed to the Lambda as `SECRET_KEY_ARN` and resolved at cold start in `lambda/handler.py`
- Terraform backend key: `ffm/prod/terraform.tfstate`
- CI deploy flow is in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

The deploy workflow currently:

1. runs FFM backend tests (`test-ffm` job, gates both PRs and pushes to `main`)
2. `terraform apply`s `infra/terraform/sites/ffm/` — provisions/updates DynamoDB tables, the Secrets Manager secret, IAM policies, the CloudFront response-headers policy, and the Lambda's environment variables
3. builds a dependency-bundled Lambda zip into `sites/ffm/ffm-lambda.zip` and pushes it with `aws lambda update-function-code`
4. syncs `sites/ffm/static/` to the site bucket
5. invalidates CloudFront
6. smoke-tests `/` and `/api/health`

**Known trade-off in step 2→3:** Terraform's own `archive_file` data source (in the shared `api_backend` module) only zips `sites/ffm/lambda/` (just `handler.py`) — it does not bundle `app/` or pip dependencies, because those need Lambda-compatible (`manylinux2014`) wheels that Terraform can't easily produce. So `terraform apply` in step 2 briefly deploys that thin, non-functional zip as the Lambda's code before step 3 overwrites it with the real, fully-bundled one moments later in the same job. In practice this means a deploy has a short window (well under a minute) where a live request could hit `ModuleNotFoundError` before step 3 completes. Acceptable for this project's traffic level, but if it ever needs to become a non-issue, the fix is to build the dependency-bundled directory *before* running `terraform apply` and point `lambda_source_dir` at that pre-built directory instead of `sites/ffm/lambda/`, then drop the separate `update-function-code` step entirely so Terraform is the single source of truth for both code and config.

## Local development and validation

Known-good automated checks:

- `pip install -r sites/ffm/requirements-dev.txt && SECRET_KEY=ci-test-key pytest sites/ffm/tests/ -q --tb=short`
- `node --test sites/ffm/static/game/levels.test.js`

Important local-dev caveat:

- `api.js` uses `window.location.origin + '/api'`, so the frontend expects the API on the same origin.
- Serving `sites/ffm/static/` from a plain static file server is fine for canvas-only work, but auth/high-score/leaderboard flows will fail unless that same origin also exposes the Flask API.
- Because the refresh flow relies on cookies, cross-origin hacks are brittle; for end-to-end auth work, prefer an environment that really serves both the static app and `/api/*` together.

## Historical drift / gotchas

These are the things most likely to mislead a future session:

- The original build prompt in `ffm-math-game.prompt.md` describes a **40-level** plan; the shipped code and tests use **60 levels**.
- `sites/ffm/app/models.py` is DynamoDB access code, not SQLAlchemy models.
- `sites/ffm/build/` and `sites/ffm/ffm-lambda.zip` are packaging artifacts, not source.
- `sites/ffm/templates/` is effectively unused by the current static-frontend/JSON-API architecture.
- Some names are stale:
  - `triggerWaveClear()` is really the level-end transition in the current implementation.
  - `waveNumber` exists in state without a corresponding multi-wave runtime.

## Fast file map for common tasks

### Change gameplay rules or scoring

Start with:

- `sites/ffm/static/game/main.js`
- `sites/ffm/static/game/levels.js`

Start with:

- `sites/ffm/static/game/renderer.js`
- `sites/ffm/static/game/entities.js`
- `sites/ffm/static/styles.css`

### Change auth/profile/leaderboard behavior

Start with:

- `sites/ffm/static/game/api.js`
- `sites/ffm/static/game/main.js`
- `sites/ffm/app/auth.py`
- `sites/ffm/app/main.py`
- `sites/ffm/app/models.py`

### Change deployment/infrastructure

Start with:

- `infra/terraform/sites/ffm/main.tf`
- `infra/terraform/sites/ffm/variables.tf`
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

## Recommended working order for future changes

1. Read this file.
2. Verify whether the change is frontend-only, backend-only, or cross-cutting.
3. For gameplay changes, check `main.js` and `levels.js` before touching art or API code.
4. For persistence/leaderboard changes, check both `main.py` and `models.py`; many behaviors are split between validation and DynamoDB shape decisions.
5. Run the smallest relevant tests:
   - curriculum/problem changes -> Node test
   - auth/profile/leaderboard/backend changes -> pytest
   - cross-cutting changes -> both
